# Apotheosis

###### /!\\ Do not use this project yet, it is incomplete /!\\

This repository hosts a build environment for the Apotheosis operating system.

Clone this repository and run `build.sh`.  You'll need Lua 5.3 or newer, bash, and probably a Unix-like system due to heavy dependence on `io.popen` and Unix commands throughout the build process.
