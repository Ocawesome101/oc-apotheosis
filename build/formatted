        man - an interface to the system reference manuals

[97mSYNOPSIS[39m
        [97mman[39m [[93m[39m] [95mpage[39m ...

[97mDESCRIPTION
        man[39m is the system's manual pager.  Each [95mpage[39m argument given to [97mman[39m is normally the name if a program, utility, or function.  The [95mmanual page[39m associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A [93msection[39m, if provided, will direct [97mman[39m to look only in that [93msection[39m of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available [93msections[39m following a pre-defined order (see [97mDEFAULTS[39m), and to show only the first [95mpage[39m found, even if [95mpage[39m found, even if [95mpage[39m exists in several [93msections[39m.

        The table below shows the [93msection[39m numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

        1   Executable programs or shell commands
        2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
        3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
        4   Special files (not present in the Apotheosis system, but standard)
        5   File formats and conventions, e.g. [93m/etc/passwd[39m)
        6   Games
        7   Miscellaneous (including conventions), e.g. [97mfmt[39m([97m7[39m)
        8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
        9   Kernel routines [non-standard]

        A manual [95mpage[39m consists of several sections.

        Conventional section names include [97mNAME[39m, [97mSYNOPSIS[39m, [97mCONFIGURATION[39m, [97mDESCRIPTION[39m, [97mOPTIONS[39m, [97mEXIT STATUS[39m, [97mRETURN VALUE[39m, [97mERRORS[39m, [97mENVIRONMENT[39m, [97mFILES[39m, [97mVERSIONS[39m, [97mCONFORMING TO[39m, [97mNOTES[39m, [97mBUGS[39m, [97mEXAMPLE[39m, [97mAUTHORS[39m, and [97mSEE ALSO[39m.

        The following conventions apply to the [97mSYNOPSIS[39m section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

        [97mbold text[39m         type exactly as shown.
        [95mpurple text[39m       replace with appropriate argument.
        [[97m-abc[39m]            any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
        [97m-a[39m|[97m-b[39m       options delimited by | cannot be used together.
        [95margument[39m ...      [95margument[39m is repeatable
        [[95marguments[39m] ...   entire [93mexpression[39m within [ ] is repeatable.

        Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will not be able to render colored text when running in a monochrome terminal.

        The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the [97mSYNOPSIS[39m section of this manual page.
