\b7NAME\c9
\tfilesystem - simple filesystem API

\b7DESCRIPTION\c9
\tThis API provides an abstraction layer over the kernel's filesystem interface.  It is intended to complement ths \b7io\c9(\b72\c9) library, and does not provide any alternative versions of functionality.  Instead, \b7filesystem\c9 deals with operations such as creating directories, something the \b7io\c9(\b72\c9) library cannot do.
