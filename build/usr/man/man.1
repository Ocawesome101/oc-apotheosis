\b7NAME\c9
\tman - an interface to the system reference manuals

\b7SYNOPSIS\c9
\t\b7man\c9 [\b3\c9] \b5page\c9 ...

\b7DESCRIPTION
\tman\c9 is the system's manual pager.  Each \b5page\c9 argument given to \b7man\c9 is normally the name if a program, utility, or function.  The \b5manual page\c9 associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A \b3section\c9, if provided, will direct \b7man\c9 to look only in that \b3section\c9 of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available \b3sections\c9 following a pre-defined order (see \b7DEFAULTS\c9), and to show only the first \b5page\c9 found, even if \b5page\c9 found, even if \b5page\c9 exists in several \b3sections\c9.

\tThe table below shows the \b3section\c9 numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

\t1   Executable programs or shell commands
\t2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
\t3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
\t4   Special files (not present in the Apotheosis system, but standard)
\t5   File formats and conventions, e.g. \b3/etc/passwd\c9)
\t6   Games
\t7   Miscellaneous (including conventions), e.g. \b7fmt\c9(\b77\c9)
\t8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
\t9   Kernel routines [non-standard]

\tA manual \b5page\c9 consists of several sections.

\tConventional section names include \b7NAME\c9, \b7SYNOPSIS\c9, \b7CONFIGURATION\c9, \b7DESCRIPTION\c9, \b7OPTIONS\c9, \b7EXIT STATUS\c9, \b7RETURN VALUE\c9, \b7ERRORS\c9, \b7ENVIRONMENT\c9, \b7FILES\c9, \b7VERSIONS\c9, \b7CONFORMING TO\c9, \b7NOTES\c9, \b7BUGS\c9, \b7EXAMPLE\c9, \b7AUTHORS\c9, and \b7SEE ALSO\c9.

\tThe following conventions apply to the \b7SYNOPSIS\c9 section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

\t\b7bold text\c9         type exactly as shown.
\t\b5purple text\c9       replace with appropriate argument.
\t[\b7-abc\c9]            any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
\t\b7-a\c9|\b7-b\c9       options delimited by | cannot be used together.
\t\b5argument\c9 ...      \b5argument\c9 is repeatable
\t[\b5arguments\c9] ...   entire \b3expression\c9 within [ ] is repeatable.

\tExact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will not be able to render colored text when running in a monochrome terminal.

\tThe command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the \b7SYNOPSIS\c9 section of this manual page.

\b7EXAMPLES

\b7OVERVIEW\c9
  \tContrary to the 

\b7DEFAULTS\c9
\tThe order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $\b7MANSECT\c9.  By default it is as follows:
