\b7NAME\c9
\trm - remove files or directories

\b7SYNOPSIS\c9
\trm [\b5OPTION\c9]... [\b5FILE\c9]...

\b7DESCRIPTION\c9
\tThis manual page documents the Apotheosis version of \b7rm\c9.  \b7rm\c9 removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

\tWhen called with no arguments, \b7rm\c9 will print a simple help message.

\b7OPTIONS\c9
\tRemove the \b5FILE\c9(s).

\t\b7-f\c9
\t\tignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

\t\b7-r\c9
\t\tremove directories and their contents recursively

\tBy default \b7rm\c9 does not remove directories.  Use the \b7-r\c9 option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

\tTo remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '\b5-foo'c9', use one of these commands:

\t\t\b7rm\c9 -- \b7-foo\c9

\t\t\b7rm\c9 ./\b7-foo\c9

\tNote that if you use \b7rm\c9 to remove a file from an unmanaged filesystem, it might be possible to recover some or all of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using \b7shred\c9.
